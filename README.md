# PyContacts


"I developed a contact management system using Python, leveraging Tkinter for the user interface. The application allows users to store and manage their contacts efficiently. It includes features like adding new contacts, editing existing ones, searching for contacts, and deleting entries. Tkinter's GUI capabilities make it intuitive and user-friendly, enhancing the overall experience."
